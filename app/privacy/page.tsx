          <p>
            PostgresMac is a local-only PostgreSQL macOS client. We do not
            collect, transmit, store, or share any of your personal information
            or usage data.
          </p>

          <p>
            All data used by PostgresMac, including database credentials,
            connection profiles, SQL queries, and results, remains exclusively
            on your Mac. Database passwords are stored securely in your macOS
            Keychain. Connection information is stored in your application's
            local storage. No data is synchronized to iCloud or any cloud
            service.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only network connections made by PostgresMac are directly to the
            PostgreSQL database servers you explicitly configure and connect to.
            We are not an intermediary in these connections. PostgresMac does
            not use any third-party services including analytics platforms,
            crash reporting services, advertising networks, or cloud storage
            services.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have complete control over your data. You can delete connection
            profiles directly in the app, which also removes associated
            passwords from macOS Keychain. Uninstalling PostgresMac removes the
            application and its local data. No data remains on our servers
            because no data was ever sent to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we ever introduce features that involve data collection, cloud
            synchronization, or online services in the future, this Privacy
            Policy will be updated accordingly, you will be clearly notified,
            and any such features will be optional and require explicit consent.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at
            fikri@mghazi.com.
